DSA mini project on application of stack or queue.

Click on *d_netflix* to start the program.
</br></br>
**Application of stack ->**
</br>
• *Uploading movie:* When a movie is uploaded by server then it behaves in a “push” manner of
stack, where every movie is placed at the top of stack. Stack is our database.
</br>
• *Usage History:* When a movie is watched then its history is created which is “push” of that
particular title and when a history of a client is asked then a “pop” is made from history,
therefore it follows “first in last out” order.
</br></br>
**Application of queue ->**
</br>
• *Available movie:* When available movies option is used then a “dequeue” is made from database.
</br>
• *Movie recommendation:* A client can recommend a movie which is “enqueue” in
recommendations and then after when server checks for recommendations those movies are
“dequeue”, so it follows “first in first out” order.
